This repository contains a thorough analysis of IPL from 2008 to 2022 data with SQL and Power BI. The data was downloaded from Kaggle and with a bit of cleaning was made suitable for the analysis. It also contains important insights and conclusions which are evident from the analysis. For better understanding and visualization of insights some of the analysis was also accompanied by charts.
